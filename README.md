A first attempt at programming a chess engine

This repo is a __work in progress__. It is primarily a fun side project that I am using to learn about chess programming. In any case, a chess engine written in Python is unlikely to take on Stockfish or Leela anytime soon. We'll leave that to a future iteration in a faster language ("GOppy", perhaps :smirk: )
